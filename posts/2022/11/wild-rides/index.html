<hr>
<h2 id="the-facts">The facts</h2>
<p>In September 2022, Nearside was acquired by Plastiq, a company in the SMB/B2B payments space. In November, they announced that &ldquo;due to macroeconomic conditions&rdquo;, they would be shutting down all Nearside products - the Business Bank Account as well as Line of Credit – by EOY, with most access being shut off in early December. Naturally, this also means that the Nearside mobile apps will be spun down as well.</p>
<h2 id="things-i-believe-are-true">Things I believe are true</h2>
<ul>
<li>Startups fail for any number of reasons, only some of which are under our control <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup></li>
<li>I worked really darn hard for the past 2.5 years</li>
<li>I, as an well-intentioned, competent individual, am only capable of <code>N</code> amount of impact at a job (both positive and negative)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="and-yet">And yet&hellip;</h2>
<p>I <em>know</em> my individual contribution was important (or else they wouldn&rsquo;t have paid me!), but I also <em>know</em> that shit happens beyond my purview. I&rsquo;ve worked on 9 apps/SDKs in my professional career (including Nearside), and for the most part, all of those apps still exist<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>. It&rsquo;s wild to me that all the work we did over the past 2 years and 4 months just <em>ceases to exist</em>.</p>
<p>All the stuff I cared so deeply about – docs, code comments, CI, linting rules, Gradle plugins – it just vanishes.</p>
<p>&ldquo;At least you made peoples&rsquo; lives better for a while!&rdquo; some of you might say. Actually, I don&rsquo;t know that that&rsquo;s true! Imagine your bank told you that your account would close in 22 calendar days – how chaotic would that be? Taking aside things like direct deposit and payroll, which take a <em>minimum</em> of 10 business days to change, there&rsquo;s credit cards, utilities, quarterly recurring payments&hellip;the list goes on. As bad as I feel for all the work I did just going <em>*poof*</em>, I feel 100x worse that we made tens of thousands of small business owners&rsquo; lives measurably more complicated.</p>
<h2 id="thems-the-breaks-right">Them&rsquo;s the breaks, right?</h2>
<p>Yeah, for sure, I was under no such delusion that</p>
<ol>
<li>working at a startup (for the 4th time) would guarantee me stable employment<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>, or</li>
<li>that this specific startup would ever amount to anything</li>
</ol>
<p>Between you and me, I was sorta 🤞🏽hoping🤞🏽 that both items would be true. Still, there&rsquo;s a difference between intellectually &ldquo;knowing&rdquo; that things could theoretically go south and having to actually run a layoff.</p>
<hr>
<p>I&rsquo;ve liked working in small groups for as long as I can remember. Group assignments in high school with 7 of us were intolerable, but I still fondly remember a few projects I got to work on in groups of 2 or 3. I suppose this (along with other reasons that I should broach in therapy) is why I really really enjoy working at startups. We&rsquo;re all cogs in the capitalist machine; I just really enjoy being able to see the top of the machine from where I&rsquo;m sitting!</p>
<p>And working <del>as a cog</del> at a startup can be such a joy! You want a coffee chat with the founder or COO? Yeah no problem, you just walk over to their desk (or ping them on Slack) and ask! It&rsquo;s not weird, you already know each other – in fact, they were probably on your interview loop!<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.<br>
You have inside jokes with senior leadership – not because you&rsquo;re special or cool or particularly funny, but because the company All Hands last week was 25 people and everyone is still allowed to be funny and not-serious without it setting the wrong tone.
Finally, even well-funded startups are understaffed relative to their mission, and so the easiest way to curry favor with <em>literally anyone</em> is to throw a 15 min 1:1/sync on their calendar (with sufficient warning!) and ask <em>&ldquo;So how can I make your life easier?&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Working at a small venture-funded company isn&rsquo;t all unicorn farts and rainbow lollipops. VC funding itself is a tricky beast – on one hand, it pays for our <a href="https://www.levels.fyi/t/software-engineer/levels/senior/locations/san-francisco-bay-area">salaries that any reasonable person would call exorbitant</a> &ndash; good luck paying rent in any major metro area otherwise! On the other hand, VC money is somewhat akin to the <a href="https://pirates.fandom.com/wiki/Treasure_of_Cort%C3%A9s">cursed Treasure of Cortés in Pirates of the Carribean</a> – you are damned by the action of taking it, not by the amount. Now, admittedly, that&rsquo;s a bit melodramatic<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>, but taking VC money does mean you&rsquo;re always looking and hoping for that next raise; your OKRs aren&rsquo;t necessarily tied to profit, they might be tied to engagement or other traction-related metrics. When you do raise that next round, it&rsquo;s often based on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Product/market_fit">PMF</a> rather than whether your business is actually sustainable. This, in my opinion, is the core of the VC-funding reality-distortion field that exists in tech.</p>
