Hi! I'm Parth, an Android developer living in San Francisco (but soon to be Washington, D.C.!) 

I've been doing Android since 2013; in my free time, I enjoy: Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu, travel, eating+cooking a concerning amount of food, and other things too!

I studied Linguistics & Cognitive Science at Claremont McKenna College, and I continue to be an insufferable language(s) nerd.   

Places I've worked:

- [Front](https://front.app)
- [August Home](https://august.com)
- [Originate](https://www.originate.com/)
