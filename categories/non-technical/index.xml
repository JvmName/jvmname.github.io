      <description>ed. note: Nothing in this blog post should be taken as statement of fact unless I specifically write &amp;ldquo;at ${company}, ${thing} happened&amp;rdquo;.

In November, they announced that &amp;ldquo;due to macroeconomic conditions&amp;rdquo;, they would be shutting down all Nearside products - the Business Bank Account as well as Line of Credit â€“ by EOY, with most access being shut off in early December.</description>
